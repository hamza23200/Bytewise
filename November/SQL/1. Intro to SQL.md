# SQL

Interact with relational data base managment sys 
(Software Apllictaion used to manage and create diffrent databases)

Realtional database management  (MySQL)
Queries used for database queries
take info out of database

What is Database(DB)?
* A database is an organized collection of data, which can be easily accessed and managed.
* You can organize data into tables, rows, columns, and index it to make it easier to find relevant 
  information.
* To create a database you need a Software or Database Managmeny Systems(DBMS).
This can easily manage large data, Handle Security, Backup, Import/export
* The main purpose of the database is to operate a Huge amount of information by storing,
  retrieving, and managing data.
* Core operation of DBMS  =  C.R.U.D ( Create, Read, Update, Delete)
* There are many dynamic websites which are handled through databases.
  For example, a model that checks the availability of flights.
* There are many databases available like MySQL, Sybase, Oracle, MongoDB, Informix, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.
* SQL or Structured Query Language is used to operate on the data stored in a database.

Relational vs Non relational sql (no sql)
* Relational databases provide a store of related data tables(spreadsheet)
* These tables use SQL (Structured Query Language) to manage data
* No-SQL databases refer to high-performance, non-relational data .

Queries are requests made to the database management system for specific information

As the database's structure become more and more complex,
it becomes more difficult to get the specific pieces of information we want.
