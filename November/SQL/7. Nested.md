# Nested Query

```SQL
SELECT employee.first_name, employee.last_name
FROM employee
WHERE employee.emp_id IN(
SELECT works_with.emp_id
FROM works with
WHERE works with.total sales > 30000;)
# Shows ppl with more than 30k sales
# use IN when you get nore than 1 results 

SELECT client.client_name
FROM Client
WHERE client.branch_id =(
SELECT branch.branch_id
FROM branch
WHERE branch.mgr_id=2
LIMIT 1);
#give client names which 102 manages
```

# On Delete
what if some data gets deleted in the table for example employee id 102 get deleted

ON DELETE NULL = sets the values to NULL
ON DELETE CASCADE = delete entire row in database

Primary keys cant be null so always set that to CASCADE

# Triggers
Define certain action which should happen when a certain operation is done
```SQL
CREATE TABLE trigger_test ( 
message VARCHAR(200)
);

DELIMITER $$  # ;->$$
CREATE
   TRIGGER my_trigger BEFORE INSERT
   ON employee
   FOR EACH ROW BEGIN
     INSERT INTO trigger_test VALUES( 'added new employee');
END $$
DELIMITER ; # $$->;
#DELIMITER is basically the ending symbol of statment like normally its ';'
#before anything is inserted in table promt the message

SELECT * FROM trigger_test;

#trigger code added to liveserver program 
```
