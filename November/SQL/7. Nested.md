# Nested Query

```SQL
SELECT employee.first_name, employee.last_name
FROM employee
WHERE employee.emp_id IN(
SELECT works_with.emp_id
FROM works with
WHERE works with.total sales > 30000;)
# Shows ppl with more than 30k sales
# use IN when you get nore than 1 results 

SELECT client.client_name
FROM Client
WHERE client.branch_id =(
SELECT branch.branch_id
FROM branch
WHERE branch.mgr_id=2
LIMIT 1);
#give client names which 102 manages
```

# On Delete
what if some data gets deleted in the table for example employee id 102 get deleted

ON DELETE NULL = sets the values to NULL
ON DELETE CASCADE = delete entire row in database

Primary keys cant be null so always set that to CASCADE
