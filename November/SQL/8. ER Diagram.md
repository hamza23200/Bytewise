# Entity Realtion(ER) Diagrams

* Entity - An object we want to model & store information about (student)
* Attributes - Specific pieces of information about an entity (gpa, student id)
* Primary Key - An attribute(s) that uniquely identify an entry in the 
database table  (underline) (student id)
* Composite Attribute - An attribute thatcan be broken up into sub-attributes (fname,lname)
* Multi-valued Attribute - An attribute that can have more than one value (clubs)
* Derived Attribute - An attribute that can be derived from the other attributes (honors)

* Multiple Entities - You can define more than one entity in the diagram

# Designing ER Diagram

## Company Data Requirements
The company is organized into branches. Each branch has a unique number, a name, and a
particular employee who manages it.

The company makes it's money by selling to clients. Each client has a name and a unique
umber to identify it.

The foundation of the company is it's employees. Each employee has a name,birthday,
sex,salary and a unique number.

An employee can work for one branch at a time,and each branch will be managed by one of
the employees that work there. We'll also want to keep track of when the current manager
started as manager.

An employee can act as a supervisor for other employees at the branch, an employee may
also act as the supervisor for employees at other branches. An employee can have at most
one supervisor.

A branch may handle a number of clients, with each client having a name and a unique
number to identify it. A single client may only be handled by one branch at a time.

Employees can work with clients controlled by their branch to sell them stuff. If nescessary
multiple employees can work with the same client. We'll want to keep track of how many
dollars worth of stuff each employee sells to each client they work with.

Many branches will need to work with suppliers to buy inventory. For each supplier we'll keep
track of their name and the type of product they're selling the branch. A single supplier may
supply products to multiple branches.
