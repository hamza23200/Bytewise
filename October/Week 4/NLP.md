# Natural Language Processing
* NPL is a branch of computer science and specifiaclly branch of artificial intelligence.
* NLP allows making computers perform useful tasks with the natural languages which humans use.
* NLP gives computers the ability to understand text and spoken words in the same way humans can.
* NLP involves communication between humans and machines using natural language like english etc.

# Applications of NLP
* Speech Recognition
* Sentiment Analysis( analyzing social media,moview review analysis)
* Machine Translation( Google translate)
* Auto-Correct
* Chat Bot
* Text Classification
 
# Components
* I/P
* Speech Recognition
* Natural Language Understanding(NLU)
* Natural Language Generation(NLG)
* O/P

## Natural Language Understanding(NLU)
It help machine to understand user.
Interpret the data by user and get the meaning of what user want to say?
Analyzing different aspects of the language.


### Lexical ambiguity
In this phase text is divided in sepearte Chuncks.
Each Chunck can have multiple meanings.
E.g
The Tank was full of water
now which tank?? military or water tank

### Syntatic ambiguity
Ambiguity in the structure. 
Old man and women were taken to safe place. 
In this example it is difficult for machine to understand 
either they are talking about old man and women or both.

### Semantic ambiguity
Ambiguity in their meaning.

Retrieves the possible meanings of a sentence that is clear and semantically correct. 
Its process of retrieving meaningful insights from text. For example, The car hit the Pole While it was moving.
In the above statement, we dont know if car is moving or people


### Pragmatic ambiguity
In which context of the sentence gives the multiple interpretation. 
E.g The police are coming.
There are multiples interpretations of above sentence.Why police is coming?, Where is coming? etc.

## Natural Language Generation(NLG)
In this part of NLP machine generating the output in a natural language based on the input provided by the user.
The output is come in a language is same as input given by user in which language
It should be Intelligent and Conversational
Text/sentence Planning

Output
