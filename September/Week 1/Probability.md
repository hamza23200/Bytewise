# Probability
Likelihood of an event 
P=(no. ways of a event)/total ways

## Mutually Exclusive
Only 1 thing in possible in sample space (H or T)
Additive Rule
P (1 or 2 or 3)= P(1)+P(2)+P(3)
## NON-Mutually Exclusive 
P (A or B)= P(A)+P(B)-P(A n B)

## Independent Event 
Total outcome value does not depend on no. of experiments like
S=[H,T,H] P(H)=1/2, P(T)=1/2
P(A and B)=P(A)*P(B)
## Dependent Event 
e.g deck of cards
exp 1: P(K)=1/52
exp 2: P(Q)=1/51
exp 3: P(J)=1/50
P(A and B)=P(A)*P(B/A)
P(K and Q)=1/52 * 1/51

In ML you get values in Probabilities like 25% belong to category A
