# Number Guessing Game
This game that will show you make a correct guess of number or not. If you make a guess then message will display either you are above the guess or below the guess. And if we enter any alphabet or negative number then message will appear Please enter a number next time.

```python
import random #random no.

        print("Please type a number larger than 0 next time.")
        quit()

else:
    print("Please type a number next time.")
    quit()
